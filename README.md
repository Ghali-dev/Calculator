# 🧲 Simple Calculator

Welcome to my humble calculator project! This is a basic calculator built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — nothing too fancy, but it gets the job done. It's capable of handling basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

This project is part of my learning journey with today' sponsor **[The Odin Project]** — specifically the Foundations path. I'm building this (and many other projects) to sharpen my frontend skills and get a stronger grasp of how JavaScript interacts with the DOM.(just kiddin not sponsored #noAD)

## 🔧 Features

* Fully functional number and operator buttons
* Clear (`C`) and Delete (`del`) functionality
* Real-time input displayed in a screen-like UI
* Handles decimal points (no spamming dots, don’t worry)
* Snarky little message when trying to divide by zero (we are so silly aren't we (me) 😅)
* Basic input validation to avoid broken calculations
* Clean, centered layout using Flexbox

---

## 🎯 What I Learned

* DOM manipulation through JavaScript
* Event listeners and user input handling
* Creating and chaining basic arithmetic functions
* Preventing invalid input (like multiple decimals)
* The struggle of spacing buttons evenly with CSS 😤
* Organizing code into clean, readable logic

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator.git
   cd calculator
   
   or however idk actually not my problem you figure it out
   

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser. Boom, you’re ready to crunch numbers.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

* Keyboard support (so you can type instead of click)
* More responsive/mobile-friendly UI
* Better visual feedback for button presses
* Maybe theme switching? (YIPPIIIE MORE WORK YUM YUM)

## 👋 Final Note

This project is just one step in my web dev journey, but I’m proud of it. Every line of code is helping me get better — even if some lines were painful to debug (also spent 2 months on it for some reason don't ask why cuz I have no idea myself). Thanks to The Odin Project for making learning feel structured and kinda fun. #not_sponsored #kindaGlazing

Peace and dat✌️
